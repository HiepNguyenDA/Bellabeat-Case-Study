## Project Details

### Business Task

Urška Sršen, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, has tasked the marketing analytics team with analyzing smart device usage data to identify trends in how consumers use non-Bellabeat products. The goal is to gain insights that can be applied to improve Bellabeat's own smart devices and marketing strategies.

### Key Objectives

1. **Product Optimization**: Identify features, functionalities, and design elements that resonate with users to optimize Bellabeat's offerings.
2. **Competitive Advantage**: Apply trends and best practices observed in the broader smart device market to stay competitive and innovative.
3. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Use real user behavior and preferences to make informed and strategic business decisions.
4. **Targeted Marketing**: Inform marketing strategies by identifying the most effective messaging, channels, and value propositions.

### Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is the Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data, which includes data from 33 Fitbit users. The data covers various metrics such as daily activity, steps, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

### Data Preparation and Cleaning

The data was cleaned and processed using Python and MySQL. Key steps included:
- Checking for duplicates and missing values.
- Transforming date formats for consistency.
- Aggregating data to make it useful and accessible for analysis.

### Analysis and Insights

Key findings from the analysis include:
- A strong positive correlation between total sleep time and time in bed.
- A mostly linear relationship between steps and calorie expenditure.
- Identification of user activity levels, with 51.5% classified as "Physically Inactive."

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following high-level recommendations were made:
1. **Promote Active Lifestyles**: Target the physically inactive segment with personalized goal-setting, activity challenges, and educational resources.
2. **Sleep Optimization Features**: Develop features that provide personalized sleep duration recommendations and tips for optimizing sleep environments.
3. **Accurate Calorie Estimation**: Enhance calorie tracking features based on step data to provide users with reliable calorie expenditure estimates.
4. **Targeted Marketing Campaigns**: Develop marketing campaigns tailored to specific user segments based on their activity levels and sleep patterns.
